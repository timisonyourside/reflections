When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Sharing with other contributors.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Using git log or git diff, you are able to see all the changes to the remote that happened while you are offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Talk on phone? Voice-to-voice, but harder since this method wouldn't have the rigot to manage complex changes effectively.
