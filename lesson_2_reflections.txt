What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

.git directory is created to track the repo metadata.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The remote repository may have unapproved changes that you do not want to propogate to the local repo.
